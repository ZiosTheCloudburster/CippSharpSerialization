## Dependencies
- [Containers](https://github.com/ZiosTheCloudburster/CippSharpCoreContainers.git) → tag 1.1.X,
- [UtilsAndExtensions](https://github.com/ZiosTheCloudburster/CippSharpCoreUtilsAndExtensions.git) → tag 1.1.X

### Content:
Contains CustomDataPairs and BinaryHolder and few examples with 'tips'.

### How to Install:
- Option 1 (suggested) add this as submodule / separate repo in your project by copy/paste the git url
then navigate TAGs for releases.
- Option 2 (readonly) it supports UnityPackageManager so you can download by copy/paste the git url in 'PackageManagerWindow + Install From Git'.
    As said this is a readonly solution so you cannot access all  this way.
